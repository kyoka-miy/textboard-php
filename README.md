This project was for university students in Japan to learn programming and build an actual app. 
This is a simple text board app, first we built using PHP, and then linked it with database using MySQL.
All of my team mates were beginners at first, but finally we managed to finish this project before the deadline.
I as a team leader, managed team mates' schedules, helped them to solve errors and organized team meetings.
